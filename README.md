Sumo Logic Dashboard Exporter
=============================

This project is a wrapper around the dashboard API to export results into a file.

Installing the Scripts
=======================

The scripts are designed to be used within a batch script or DevOPs tool such as Chef or Ansible.
Each python3 script has complete list of python modules to aid people using a pip install.

You will need to use Python 3.6 or higher and the modules listed in the dependency section.  

The installation steps are as follows: 

    1. Download and install python 3.6 or higher from python.org. Append python3 to the LIB and PATH env.

    2. Download and install git for your platform if you don't already have it installed.
       It can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    3. Open a new shell/command prompt. It must be new since only a new shell will include the new python 
       path that was created in step 1. Cd to the folder where you want to install the scripts.
    
    4. Execute the following command to install pipenv, which will manage all of the library dependencies:
    
        sudo -H pip3 install pipenv 
 
    5. Clone this repository. This will create a new folder
    
    6. Change into this folder. Type the following to install all the package dependencies 
       (this may take a while as this downloads all of the libraries necessary):

        pipenv install

Script Names and Purposes
=========================

The scripts are organized into sub directories:

    1. ./bin - 
           ./bin/sumo_dashboardexport.py - download the results as PDF files

NOTE: this script required three items

    1. A Sumo API key name
    2. A Sumo API secret string 
    3. A Sumo Dashboard ID
